	abstract = {A thought disorder ({TD}) is a disturbance in cognition which affects language, thought and communication. Psychiatric and psychological glossaries in 2015 and 2017 identified thought disorders as encompassing poverty of ideas, paralogia (a reasoning disorder characterized by expression of illogical or delusional thoughts), word salad, and delusions—all disturbances of thought content and form. Two specific terms have been suggested—content thought disorder ({CTD}) and formal thought disorder ({FTD}). {CTD} has been defined as a thought disturbance characterized by multiple fragmented delusions, and the term thought disorder is often used to refer to an {FTD}: a disruption of the form (or structure) of thought. Also known as disorganized thinking, {FTD} results in disorganized speech and is recognized as a major feature of schizophrenia and other psychoses (including mood disorders, dementia, mania, and neurological diseases). Disorganized speech leads to an inference of disorganized thought. Thought disorders include derailment, pressured speech, poverty of speech, tangentiality, verbigeration, and thought blocking. One of the first known cases of thought disorders, or specifically {OCD} as it is known today, was in 1691. John Moore, who was a bishop, had a speech in front of Queen Mary {II}, about "religious melancholy."
Formal thought disorder affects the form (rather than the content) of thought. Unlike hallucinations and delusions, it is an observable, objective sign of psychosis. {FTD} is a common core symptom of a psychotic disorder, and may be seen as a marker of severity and as an indicator of prognosis. It reflects a cluster of cognitive, linguistic, and affective disturbances that have generated research interest in the fields of cognitive neuroscience, neurolinguistics, and psychiatry.
Eugen Bleuler, who named schizophrenia, said that {TD} was its defining characteristic. Disturbances of thinking and speech, such as clanging or echolalia, may also be present in Tourette syndrome; other symptoms may be found in delirium. A clinical difference exists between these two groups. Patients with psychoses are less likely to show awareness or concern about disordered thinking, and those with other disorders are aware and concerned about not being able to think clearly.},

	abstract = {Anti-psychiatry, sometimes spelled antipsychiatry, is a movement based on the view that psychiatric treatment can be often more damaging than helpful to patients. The term anti-psychiatry was coined in 1912, and the movement emerged in the 1960s, highlighting controversies about psychiatry. Objections include the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis, the questionable effectiveness and harm associated with psychiatric medications, the failure of psychiatry to demonstrate any disease treatment mechanism for psychiatric medication effects, and legal concerns about equal human rights and civil freedom being nullified by the presence of diagnosis. Historical critiques of psychiatry came to light after focus on the extreme harms associated with electroconvulsive therapy and insulin shock therapy. The term "anti-psychiatry" is in dispute and often used to dismiss all critics of psychiatry, many of whom agree that a specialized role of helper for people in emotional distress may at times be appropriate, and allow for individual choice around treatment decisions.
Beyond concerns about effectiveness, anti-psychiatry might question the philosophical and ethical underpinnings of psychotherapy and psychoactive medication, seeing them as shaped by social and political concerns rather than the autonomy and integrity of the individual mind. They may believe that "judgements on matters of sanity should be the prerogative of the philosophical mind", and that the mind should not be a medical concern. Some activists reject the psychiatric notion of mental illness. Anti-psychiatry considers psychiatry a coercive instrument of oppression due to an unequal power relationship between doctor, therapist, and patient or client, and a highly subjective diagnostic process. Involuntary commitment, which can be enforced legally through sectioning, is an important issue in the movement. When sectioned, involuntary treatment may also be legally enforced by the medical profession against the patient's will. 
The decentralized movement has been active in various forms for two centuries. In the 1960s, there were many challenges to psychoanalysis and mainstream psychiatry, in which the very basis of psychiatric practice was characterized as repressive and controlling. Psychiatrists identified with the anti-psychiatry movement included Timothy Leary, R. D. Laing, Franco Basaglia, Theodore Lidz, Silvano Arieti, and David Cooper. Others involved were Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari, and Erving Goffman. Cooper used the term "anti-psychiatry" in 1967, and wrote the book Psychiatry and Anti-psychiatry in 1971. The word Antipsychiatrie was already used in Germany in 1904. Thomas Szasz introduced the definition of mental illness as a "myth" in the book The Myth of Mental Illness (1961). However his literature actually very clearly states that he was directly undermined by the movement led by David Cooper (1931–1986) and that Cooper sought to replace psychiatry with his own brand of it. Giorgio Antonucci, who advocated a non-psychiatric approach to psychological suffering, did not consider himself to be part of the antipsychiatric movement. His position is represented by "the non-psychiatric thinking, which considers psychiatry an ideology devoid of scientific content, a non-knowledge, whose aim is to annihilate people instead of trying to understand the difficulties of life, both individual and social, and then to defend people, change society, and create a truly new culture". Antonucci introduced the definition of psychiatry as a prejudice in the book I pregiudizi e la conoscenza critica alla psichiatria (1986).
The movement continues to influence thinking about psychiatry and psychology, both within and outside of those fields, particularly in terms of the relationship between providers of treatment and those receiving it. Contemporary issues include freedom versus coercion, nature versus nurture, and the right to be different.
Critics of antipsychiatry from within psychiatry itself object to the underlying principle that psychiatry is harmful, although they usually accept that there are issues that need addressing. Medical professionals often consider anti-psychiatry movements to be promoting mental illness denial, and some consider their claims to be comparable to conspiracy theories.},

	abstract = {Circumstantial speech, also referred to as circumstantiality, is the result of a so-called "non-linear thought pattern" and occurs when the focus of a conversation drifts, but often comes back to the point.

If someone exhibits circumstantial speech during a conversation, they will often seem to "talk the long way around" to their point, which may be an attempt by the speaker to include pertinent details, that may contrast with the speech which is more direct, succinct, and to the point (the gist) even at the expense of more precise, accurate communication.
Circumstantial speech is more direct than tangential speech in which the speaker wanders and drifts and usually never returns to the original topic, and is far less severe than logorrhea.},

	abstract = {Medicalization is the process by which human conditions and problems come to be defined and treated as medical conditions, and thus become the subject of medical study, diagnosis, prevention, or treatment.

Medicalization is studied from a sociologic perspective in terms of the role and power of professionals, patients, and corporations, and also for its implications for ordinary people whose self-identity and life decisions may depend on the prevailing concepts of health and illness. Once a condition is classified as medical, a medical model of disability tends to be used in place of a social model. Medicalization may also be termed pathologization or (pejoratively) "disease mongering". Since medicalization is the social process through which a condition becomes seen as a medical disease in need of treatment, appropriate medicalization may be viewed as a benefit to human society. The identification of a condition as a disease can lead to the treatment of certain symptoms and conditions, which will improve overall quality of life.},

Derailment can often be manifestly caused by intense emotions such as euphoria or hysteria.

A related term is tangentiality—it refers to off-the-point, oblique or irrelevant answers given to questions. In some studies on creativity, knight's move thinking—while describing a similarly loose association of ideas—is not considered a mental disorder or the hallmark of one; it is sometimes used as a synonym for lateral thinking.},

Initial psychiatric assessment of a person begins with creating a case history and conducting a mental status examination.

Mental disorders are diagnosed in accordance with diagnostic manuals such as the International Classification of Diseases ({ICD}), edited by the World Health Organization ({WHO}), and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ({DSM}), published by the American Psychiatric Association ({APA}). The fifth edition of the {DSM} ({DSM}-5), published in May 2013, reorganized the categories of disorders and added newer information and insights consistent with current research.
Treatment may include psychotropics (psychiatric medicines), interventional approaches and psychotherapy, and also other modalities such as assertive community treatment, community reinforcement, substance-abuse treatment, and supported employment. Treatment may be delivered on an inpatient or outpatient basis, depending on the severity of functional impairment or risk to the individual or community. Research within psychiatry is conducted on an interdisciplinary basis with other professionals, such as epidemiologists, nurses, social workers, occupational therapists, and clinical psychologists.},

	abstract = {The International Classification of Diseases ({ICD}) is a globally used medical classification used in epidemiology, health management and for clinical purposes. The {ICD} is maintained by the World Health Organization ({WHO}), which is the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations System. The {ICD} is originally designed as a health care classification system, providing a system of diagnostic codes for classifying diseases, including nuanced classifications of a wide variety of signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or disease. This system is designed to map health conditions to corresponding generic categories together with specific variations, assigning for these a designated code, up to six characters long. Thus, major categories are designed to include a set of similar diseases.
The {ICD} is published by the {WHO} and used worldwide for morbidity and mortality statistics, reimbursement systems, and automated decision support in health care. This system is designed to promote international comparability in the collection, processing, classification, and presentation of these statistics. The {ICD} is a major project to statistically classify all health disorders, and provide diagnostic assistance. The {ICD} is a core statistically based classificatory diagnostic system for health care related issues of the {WHO} Family of International Classifications ({WHO}-{FIC}).
The {ICD} is revised periodically and is currently in its 11th revision. The {ICD}-11, as it is therefore known, was accepted by {WHO}'s World Health Assembly ({WHA}) on 25 May 2019 and officially came into effect on 1 January 2022. On 11 February 2022, the {WHO} stated that 35 countries were using the {ICD}-11.
The {ICD} is part of a "family" of international classifications ({WHOFIC}) that complement each other, also including the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health ({ICF}) which focuses on the domains of functioning (disability) associated with health conditions, from both medical and social perspectives, and the International Classification of Health Interventions ({ICHI}) that classifies the whole range of medical, nursing, functioning and public health interventions.
The title of the {ICD} is formally the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, although the original title, International Classification of Diseases, is still informally the name by which it is usually known.
In the United States and some other countries, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ({DSM}) is preferred for the classification of mental disorders for some purposes.},

At inception it included 40 psychologists and psychiatrists, who had a record of scientific contributions to classification of psychopathology The {HiTOP} model aims to address limitations of traditional classification systems for mental illness, such as the {DSM}-5 and {ICD}-10, by organizing psychopathology according to evidence from research on observable patterns of mental health problems.
When the {HiTOP} model is complete, it will form a detailed hierarchical classification system for mental illness starting from the most basic building blocks and proceeding to the highest level of generality: combining individual signs and symptoms into narrow components or traits, and then combining these symptom components and traits into (in order of increasing generality) syndromes, subfactors, spectra, and superspectra. Currently, several aspects of the model are provisional or incomplete.},

	abstract = {Biological psychiatry or biopsychiatry is an approach to psychiatry that aims to understand mental disorder in terms of the biological function of the nervous system. It is interdisciplinary in its approach and draws on sciences such as neuroscience, psychopharmacology, biochemistry, genetics, epigenetics and physiology to investigate the biological bases of behavior and psychopathology. Biopsychiatry is the branch of medicine which deals with the study of  the biological function of the nervous system in mental disorders.
There is some overlap with neurology, which focuses on disorders where gross or visible pathology of the nervous system is apparent, such as epilepsy, cerebral palsy, encephalitis, neuritis, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. There is also some overlap with neuropsychiatry, which typically deals with behavioral disturbances in the context of apparent brain disorder. In contrast biological psychiatry describes the basic principles and then delves deeper into various disorders. It is structured to follow the organisation of the {DSM}-{IV}, psychiatry's primary diagnostic and classification guide. The contributions of this field explore functional neuroanatomy, imaging, and neuropsychology and pharmacotherapeutic possibilities for depression, anxiety and mood disorders, substance abuse and eating disorders, schizophrenia and psychotic disorders, and cognitive and personality disorders.
Biological psychiatry and other approaches to mental illness are not mutually exclusive, but may simply attempt to deal with the phenomena at different levels of explanation. Because of the focus on the biological function of the nervous system, however, biological psychiatry has been particularly important in developing and prescribing drug-based treatments for mental disorders.
In practice, however, psychiatrists may advocate both medication and psychological therapies when treating mental illness. The therapy is more likely to be conducted by clinical psychologists, psychotherapists, occupational therapists or other mental health workers who are more specialized and trained in non-drug approaches.
The history of the field extends back to the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates, but the phrase biological psychiatry was first used in peer-reviewed scientific literature in 1953. The phrase is more commonly used in the United States than in some other countries such as the {UK}. However the term "biological psychiatry" is sometimes used as a phrase of disparagement in controversial dispute.},

In this paper, we unveil the Helping and Empowering through Adaptive Language in Mental Enhancement ({HealMe}) model. This novel cognitive reframing therapy method effectively addresses deep-rooted negative thoughts and fosters rational, balanced perspectives. Diverging from traditional {LLM} methods, {HealMe} employs empathetic dialogue based on psychotherapeutic frameworks. It systematically guides clients through distinguishing circumstances from feelings, brainstorming alternative viewpoints, and developing empathetic, actionable suggestions. Moreover, we adopt the first comprehensive and expertly crafted psychological evaluation metrics, specifically designed to rigorously assess the performance of cognitive reframing, in both {AI}-simulated dialogues and real-world therapeutic conversations. Experimental results show that our model outperforms others in terms of empathy, guidance, and logical coherence, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential positive impact on psychotherapy.},

Compared to depression and euthymia, switching and clustering abnormalities were found in manic and mixed states, mimicking symptoms like flight of ideas. Moreover, the neuropsychological results, as well as the fact that error count did not increase whereas phonological associations did, showed that impaired inhibition abilities and distractibility could not account for the results in patients with manic symptoms. Rather, semantic overactivation in patients with manic symptoms, including mixed depression, may compensate for trait-like deficient semantic retrieval/access found in euthymia.,

No study has examined {EC} between the subjective experience of emotions and emotion expression in therapy or whether this coherence is associated with clients' well being. Natural language Processing ({NLP}) approaches have been applied to identify emotions from psychotherapy dialogue, which can be implemented to study emotional processes on a larger scale. However, these methods have yet to be used to study coherence between emotional experience and emotional expression over the course of therapy and whether it relates to clients' well-being. This work presents an end-to-end approach where we use emotion predictions from our transformer based emotion recognition model to study emotional coherence and its diagnostic potential in psychotherapy research. We first employ our transformer based approach on a Hebrew psychotherapy dataset to automatically label clients' emotions at utterance level in psychotherapy dialogues. We subsequently investigate the emotional coherence between clients' self-reported emotional states and our model-based emotion predictions. We also examine the association between emotional coherence and clients' well being. Our findings indicate a significant correlation between clients' self-reported emotions and positive and negative emotions expressed verbally during psychotherapy sessions. Coherence in positive emotions was also highly correlated with clients well-being. These results illustrate how {NLP} can be applied to identify important emotional processes in psychotherapy to improve diagnosis and treatment for clients suffering from mental-health problems.},

	abstract = {Introduction
The identification of language markers, referring to both form and content, for common mental health disorders such as major depressive disorder ({MDD}), can facilitate the development of innovative tools for early recognition and prevention. However, studies in this direction are only at the beginning and are difficult to implement due to linguistic variability and the influence of cultural contexts.

Aim
This study aims to identify language markers specific to {MDD} through an automated analysis process based on {RO}-2015 {LIWC} (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count).

Materials and methods
A sample of 62 medicated patients with {MDD} and a sample of 43 controls were assessed. Each participant provided language samples that described something that was pleasant for them.

Assessment tools
(1) Screening tests for {MDD} ({MADRS} and {DASS}-21); (2) Ro-{LIWC}2015 – Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count – a computerized text analysis software, validated for Romanian Language, that analyzes morphology, syntax and semantics of word use.

Results
Depressive patients use different approaches in sentence structure, and communicate in short sentences. This requires multiple use of the punctuation mark period, which implicitly requires directive communication, limited in exchange of ideas. Also, participants from the sample with depression mostly use impersonal pronouns, first person pronoun in plural form – not singular, a limited number of prepositions and an increased number of conjunctions, auxiliary verbs, negations, verbs in the past tense, and much less in the present tense, increased use of words expressing negative affects, anxiety, with limited use of words indicating positive affects. The favorite topics of interest of patients with depression are leisure, time and money.

Conclusion
Depressive patients use a significantly different language pattern than people without mood or behavioral disorders, both in form and content. These differences are sometimes associated with years of education and sex, and might also be explained by cultural differences.},

In this work, we present a computational approach to understanding how empathy is expressed in online mental health platforms. We develop a novel unifying theoretically-grounded framework for characterizing the communication of empathy in text-based conversations. We collect and share a corpus of 10k (post, response) pairs annotated using this empathy framework with supporting evidence for annotations (rationales). We develop a multi-task {RoBERTa}-based bi-encoder model for identifying empathy in conversations and extracting rationales underlying its predictions. Experiments demonstrate that our approach can effectively identify empathic conversations. We further apply this model to analyze 235k mental health interactions and show that users do not self-learn empathy over time, revealing opportunities for empathy training and feedback.},

In the present study, we used novel methods for the analysis of {MTT} narratives based on natural language processing ({NLP}) to investigate the relation between {SE} and {MTT}. We demonstrated that self-efficacious participants remembered and imagined experiences which were semantically less similar and contained a wider variety of contents.

Even when individuals receive professional care, assessments are intermittent and may be limited partly due to the episodic nature of psychiatric symptoms. Therefore, machine-learning technology using speech samples obtained in the clinic or remotely could one day be a biomarker to improve diagnosis and treatment. To date, reviews have only focused on using acoustic features from speech to detect depression and schizophrenia. Here, we present the first systematic review of studies using speech for automated assessments across a broader range of psychiatric disorders. Methods We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis ({PRISMA}) guidelines. We included studies from the last 10 years using speech to identify the presence or severity of disorders within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ({DSM}-5). For each study, we describe sample size, clinical evaluation method, speech-eliciting tasks, machine learning methodology, performance, and other relevant findings. Results 1395 studies were screened of which 127 studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority of studies were on depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and the remaining on post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders, and eating disorders. 63\% of studies built machine learning predictive models, and the remaining 37\% performed null-hypothesis testing only. We provide an online database with our search results and synthesize how acoustic features appear in each disorder. Conclusion Speech processing technology could aid mental health assessments, but there are many obstacles to overcome, especially the need for comprehensive transdiagnostic and longitudinal studies. Given the diverse types of data sets, feature extraction, computational methodologies, and evaluation criteria, we provide guidelines for both acquiring data and building machine learning models with a focus on testing hypotheses, open science, reproducibility, and generalizability.

	abstract = {Background
The {COVID}-19 pandemic is impacting mental health, but it is not clear how people with different types of mental health problems were differentially impacted as the initial wave of cases hit.

Objective
The aim of this study is to leverage natural language processing ({NLP}) with the goal of characterizing changes in 15 of the world’s largest mental health support groups (eg, r/schizophrenia, r/{SuicideWatch}, r/Depression) found on the website Reddit, along with 11 non–mental health groups (eg, r/{PersonalFinance}, r/conspiracy) during the initial stage of the pandemic.

Methods
We created and released the Reddit Mental Health Dataset including posts from 826,961 unique users from 2018 to 2020. Using regression, we analyzed trends from 90 text-derived features such as sentiment analysis, personal pronouns, and semantic categories. Using supervised machine learning, we classified posts into their respective support groups and interpreted important features to understand how different problems manifest in language. We applied unsupervised methods such as topic modeling and unsupervised clustering to uncover concerns throughout Reddit before and during the pandemic.

Results
We found that the r/{HealthAnxiety} forum showed spikes in posts about {COVID}-19 early on in January, approximately 2 months before other support groups started posting about the pandemic. There were many features that significantly increased during {COVID}-19 for specific groups including the categories “economic stress,” “isolation,” and “home,” while others such as “motion” significantly decreased. We found that support groups related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, eating disorders, and anxiety showed the most negative semantic change during the pandemic out of all mental health groups. Health anxiety emerged as a general theme across Reddit through independent supervised and unsupervised machine learning analyses. For instance, we provide evidence that the concerns of a diverse set of individuals are converging in this unique moment of history; we discovered that the more users posted about {COVID}-19, the more linguistically similar (less distant) the mental health support groups became to r/{HealthAnxiety} (ρ=–0.96, P{\textless}.001). Using unsupervised clustering, we found the suicidality and loneliness clusters more than doubled in the number of posts during the pandemic. Specifically, the support groups for borderline personality disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder became significantly associated with the suicidality cluster. Furthermore, clusters surrounding self-harm and entertainment emerged.

Conclusions
By using a broad set of {NLP} techniques and analyzing a baseline of prepandemic posts, we uncovered patterns of how specific mental health problems manifest in language, identified at-risk users, and revealed the distribution of concerns across Reddit, which could help provide better resources to its millions of users. We then demonstrated that textual analysis is sensitive to uncover mental health complaints as they appear in real time, identifying vulnerable groups and alarming themes during {COVID}-19, and thus may have utility during the ongoing pandemic and other world-changing events such as elections and protests.},

	abstract = {Using speech samples of 100 patients suffering from schizophrenia, bipolar illness and major depression, we addressed the question of the extent to which the linguistic abnormalities in the speech of these patients represent diagnosis-specific characteristics or constitute independent, syndrome-like dimensions of the illnesses. All speech samples were transcribed by a professional linguist who was blind to both identity and diagnosis of the patients. The majority of the deviant linguistic variables was found to be common to all three diagnostic groups under comparison, while only a few linguistic variables exhibited statistically significant between-group differences. On the other hand, when the respective variables were analysed as a multivariate entity, the variety of subtle between-group differences allowed us to discriminate between the diagnostic groups at an overall performance of 72.7\% correctly classified patients. There was an almost complete lack of association between linguistic abnormalities and psychopathology syndromes. In particular, we found no correlation between the syndrome 'formal thought disorder' and the large variety of linguistic variables used in this investigation. In consequence, we conjecture that linguistically deviant speech characteristics represent an independent syndrome complex manifested at varying intensities across mental illnesses, and that this syndrome complex deserves greater attention, not only with respect to the principal understanding of the underlying disturbances, but also as a potential target of therapeutical intervention.},

	abstract = {Background
Machine learning systems are part of the field of artificial intelligence that automatically learn models from data to make better decisions. Natural language processing ({NLP}), by using corpora and learning approaches, provides good performance in statistical tasks, such as text classification or sentiment mining.

Objective
The primary aim of this systematic review was to summarize and characterize, in methodological and technical terms, studies that used machine learning and {NLP} techniques for mental health. The secondary aim was to consider the potential use of these methods in mental health clinical practice

Methods
This systematic review follows the {PRISMA} (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis) guidelines and is registered with {PROSPERO} (Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; number {CRD}42019107376). The search was conducted using 4 medical databases ({PubMed}, Scopus, {ScienceDirect}, and {PsycINFO}) with the following keywords: machine learning, data mining, psychiatry, mental health, and mental disorder. The exclusion criteria were as follows: languages other than English, anonymization process, case studies, conference papers, and reviews. No limitations on publication dates were imposed.

Results
A total of 327 articles were identified, of which 269 (82.3\%) were excluded and 58 (17.7\%) were included in the review. The results were organized through a qualitative perspective. Although studies had heterogeneous topics and methods, some themes emerged. Population studies could be grouped into 3 categories: patients included in medical databases, patients who came to the emergency room, and social media users. The main objectives were to extract symptoms, classify severity of illness, compare therapy effectiveness, provide psychopathological clues, and challenge the current nosography. Medical records and social media were the 2 major data sources. With regard to the methods used, preprocessing used the standard methods of {NLP} and unique identifier extraction dedicated to medical texts. Efficient classifiers were preferred rather than transparent functioning classifiers. Python was the most frequently used platform.

Conclusions
Machine learning and {NLP} models have been highly topical issues in medicine in recent years and may be considered a new paradigm in medical research. However, these processes tend to confirm clinical hypotheses rather than developing entirely new information, and only one major category of the population (ie, social media users) is an imprecise cohort. Moreover, some language-specific features can improve the performance of {NLP} methods, and their extension to other languages should be more closely investigated. However, machine learning and {NLP} techniques provide useful information from unexplored data (ie, patients’ daily habits that are usually inaccessible to care providers). Before considering It as an additional tool of mental health care, ethical issues remain and should be discussed in a timely manner. Machine learning and {NLP} methods may offer multiple perspectives in mental health research but should also be considered as tools to support clinical practice.},

	abstract = {The principle of mental gravity contends that the mind uses physical gravity as a mental model or simulacrum to express the relation between the inner self and the outer world in terms of “{UP}”-ness and “{DOWN}”-ness. The simulation of increased gravity characterises a continuum of mental gravity which states includes depression as the paradigmatic example of being down, low, heavy, and slow. The physics of gravity can also be used to model spacetime curvature in depression, particularly gravitational time dilation as a property of {MG} analogous to subjective time dilation (i.e., the slowing of temporal flow in conscious experience). The principle has profound implications for the Temporo-spatial Theory of Consciousness ({TTC}) with regard to temporo-spatial alignment that establishes a “world-brain relation” that is centred on embodiment and the socialisation of conscious states. The principle of mental gravity provides the {TTC} with a way to incorporate the structure of the world into the structure of the brain, conscious experience, and thought. In concert with other theories of cognitive and neurobiological spacetime, the {TTC} can also work towards the “common currency” approach that also potentially connects the {TTC} to predictive processing frameworks such as free energy, neuronal gauge theories, and active inference accounts of depression. It gives the up/down dimension of space, as defined by the gravitational field, a unique status that is connected to both our embodied interaction with the physical world, and also the inverse, reflective, emotional but still embodied experience of ourselves.},

	abstract = {Psychedelic therapy has seen a resurgence of interest in the last decade, with promising clinical outcomes for the treatment of a variety of psychopathologies. In response to this success, several theoretical models have been proposed to account for the positive therapeutic effects of psychedelics. One of the more prominent models is “{RElaxed} Beliefs Under {pSychedelics},” which proposes that psychedelics act therapeutically by relaxing the strength of maladaptive high-level beliefs encoded in the brain. The more recent “{CANAL}” model of psychopathology builds on the explanatory framework of {RElaxed} Beliefs Under {pSychedelics} by proposing that canalization (the development of overly rigid belief landscapes) may be a primary factor in psychopathology. Here, we make use of learning theory in deep neural networks to develop a series of refinements to the original {CANAL} model. Our primary theoretical contribution is to disambiguate two separate optimization landscapes underlying belief representation in the brain and describe the unique pathologies which can arise from the canalization of each. Along each dimension, we identify pathologies of either too much or too little canalization, implying that the construct of canalization does not have a simple linear correlation with the presentation of psychopathology. In this expanded paradigm, we demonstrate the ability to make novel predictions regarding what aspects of psychopathology may be amenable to psychedelic therapy, as well as what forms of psychedelic therapy may ultimately be most beneficial for a given individual.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of depression is a major societal health concern, and there is an ongoing need to develop tools that predict who will become depressed. Past research suggests that depression changes the language we use, but it is unclear whether language is predictive of worsening symptoms. Here, we test whether the sentiment of brief written linguistic responses predicts changes in depression. Across two studies (N = 467), participants provided responses to neutral open-ended questions, narrating aspects of their lives relevant to depression (e.g., mood, motivation, sleep). Participants also completed the Patient Health Questionnaire ({PHQ}-9) to assess depressive symptoms and a risky decision-making task with periodic measurements of momentary happiness to quantify mood dynamics. The sentiment of written responses was evaluated by human raters (N = 470), Large Language Models ({LLMs}; {ChatGPT} 3.5 and 4.0), and the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count ({LIWC}) tool. We found that language sentiment evaluated by human raters and {LLMs}, but not {LIWC}, predicted changes in depressive symptoms at a three-week follow-up. Using computational modeling, we found that language sentiment was associated with current mood, but language sentiment predicted symptom changes even after controlling for current mood. In summary, we demonstrate a scalable tool that combines brief written responses with sentiment analysis by {AI} tools that matches human performance in the prediction of future psychiatric symptoms.},

	abstract = {The language and speech of individuals with psychosis reflect their impairments in cognition and motor processes. These language disturbances can be used to identify individuals with and at high risk for psychosis, as well as help track and predict symptom progression, allowing for early intervention and improved outcomes. However, current methods of language assessment—manual annotations and/or clinical rating scales—are time intensive, expensive, subject to bias, and difficult to administer on a wide scale, limiting this area from reaching its full potential. Computational methods that can automatically perform linguistic analysis have started to be applied to this problem and could drastically improve our ability to use linguistic information clinically. In this article, we first review how these automated, computational methods work and how they have been applied to the field of psychosis. We show that across domains, these methods have captured differences between individuals with psychosis and healthy controls and can classify individuals with high accuracies, demonstrating the promise of these methods. We then consider the obstacles that need to be overcome before these methods can play a significant role in the clinical process and provide suggestions for how the field should address them. In particular, while much of the work thus far has focused on demonstrating the successes of these methods, we argue that a better understanding of when and why these models fail will be crucial toward ensuring these methods reach their potential in the field of psychosis.},

Methods: A Japanese university student was utilized to scrutinize divergences in {EFT} across groups stratified by varying degrees of depression and hopelessness. The research leveraged a modified future thinking task ({FTT}), the Beck Hopelessness Scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory-{II} to gauge participants’ levels of hopelessness and depressive symptoms. Results: Consistent with prior research, the non-depressed group showed a reduction in positive {EFT}, reinforcing the idea that diminished positive future thinking is a hallmark of depressive conditions, even in the absence of a clinical diagnosis. Moreover, individuals with comorbid depression and elevated hopelessness demonstrated a significant decrease in positive {EFT} and an increase in negative {EFT}, substantiating a distinctive cognitive profile for this subgroup. This finding suggests that the presence of hopelessness exacerbates the negative cognitive biases associated with depression. Conclusions: The study emphasizes the importance of considering hopelessness as an independent construct when assessing {EFT} in clinical contexts. The pronounced impact of hopelessness on future thinking in those with depression suggests that targeted interventions, such as future-directed therapy ({FDT}), may be particularly effective for individuals with hopelessness depression by focusing on modifying negative future thinking patterns and enhancing life quality.},

	abstract = {Background
Large language models ({LLMs}) are advanced artificial neural networks trained on extensive datasets to accurately understand and generate natural language. While they have received much attention and demonstrated potential in digital health, their application in mental health, particularly in clinical settings, has generated considerable debate.

Objective
This systematic review aims to critically assess the use of {LLMs} in mental health, specifically focusing on their applicability and efficacy in early screening, digital interventions, and clinical settings. By systematically collating and assessing the evidence from current studies, our work analyzes models, methodologies, data sources, and outcomes, thereby highlighting the potential of {LLMs} in mental health, the challenges they present, and the prospects for their clinical use.

Methods
Adhering to the {PRISMA} (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, this review searched 5 open-access databases: {MEDLINE} (accessed by {PubMed}), {IEEE} Xplore, Scopus, {JMIR}, and {ACM} Digital Library. Keywords used were (mental health {OR} mental illness {OR} mental disorder {OR} psychiatry) {AND} (large language models). This study included articles published between January 1, 2017, and April 30, 2024, and excluded articles published in languages other than English.

Results
In total, 40 articles were evaluated, including 15 (38\%) articles on mental health conditions and suicidal ideation detection through text analysis, 7 (18\%) on the use of {LLMs} as mental health conversational agents, and 18 (45\%) on other applications and evaluations of {LLMs} in mental health. {LLMs} show good effectiveness in detecting mental health issues and providing accessible, destigmatized {eHealth} services. However, assessments also indicate that the current risks associated with clinical use might surpass their benefits. These risks include inconsistencies in generated text; the production of hallucinations; and the absence of a comprehensive, benchmarked ethical framework.

Conclusions
This systematic review examines the clinical applications of {LLMs} in mental health, highlighting their potential and inherent risks. The study identifies several issues: the lack of multilingual datasets annotated by experts, concerns regarding the accuracy and reliability of generated content, challenges in interpretability due to the “black box” nature of {LLMs}, and ongoing ethical dilemmas. These ethical concerns include the absence of a clear, benchmarked ethical framework; data privacy issues; and the potential for overreliance on {LLMs} by both physicians and patients, which could compromise traditional medical practices. As a result, {LLMs} should not be considered substitutes for professional mental health services. However, the rapid development of {LLMs} underscores their potential as valuable clinical aids, emphasizing the need for continued research and development in this area.

We reduced an initial 7,332 results to 46 included studies, with 89 effect sizes and 4,813 total participants. Random-effects meta-analytic modeling revealed a small but robust correlation between reduced future specificity and higher levels of depression (r = −.13, p {\textless} .001). Of the 11 moderator variables examined, the most striking effects were related to the emotional valence of future thinking (p {\textless} .001) and the sex of participants (p = .025). Namely, depression was linked to reduced specificity for positive (but not negative or neutral) future thinking, and the relationship was stronger in samples with a higher proportion of males. This meta-analysis contributes to our understanding of how prospection is altered in depression and dysphoria and, by revealing areas where current evidence is inconclusive, highlights key avenues for future research.},

Patients with schizophrenia and healthy control volunteers were administered a variety of language tasks. The speech generated was transcribed and the coherence computed using Latent Semantic Analysis ({LSA}). The discourse was also analyzed with a standard clinical measure of thought disorder. In word association and generation tasks {LSA} derived coherence scores were sensitive to differences between patients and controls, and correlated with clinical measures of thought disorder. In speech samples {LSA} could be used to localize where in sentence production incoherence occurs, predict levels of incoherence as well as whether discourse “belonged” to a patient or control. In conclusion, {LSA} can be used to assay disordered language production so as to both complement human clinical ratings as well as experimentally parse this incoherence in a theory-driven manner.},

Metaphor interpretation and use provide a useful methodology with which to probe semantics since metaphors are critical in reasoning processes and in how conceptual knowledge is organized.

The second study explored whether emotional versus non-emotional metaphorical language interpretation elicits differences in the tendencies to produce idiosyncratic (bizarre) or literal interpretations or use of other metaphors to describe the meaning of a metaphor. The third study examined the interpretation of time metaphors. We expected the time perspective in ambiguous sentences to be differentially influenced by previously presented unambiguous sentences of a specific perspective, either events moving relative to a stationary observer (moving-time) or an observer moving relative to a stationary event (moving-ego). First, we found that patients used a similar amount of figurative language as control participants. Second, we did not find any difference between the groups in terms of idiosyncratic interpretations, although patients did interpret more metaphors literally and controls utilized more figurative language. Third, we did not find evidence of a difference between the groups in terms of time perspectives influencing ambiguous target sentences differentially.

	abstract = {Introduction
Alterations of verbalized thought occur frequently in psychotic disorders. We characterize linguistic findings in individuals with schizophrenia based on the current literature, including findings relevant for differential and early diagnosis.

Methods
Review of literature published via {PubMed} search between January 2010 and May 2022.

Results
A total of 143 articles were included. In persons with schizophrenia, language-related alterations can occur at all linguistic levels. Differentiating from findings in persons with affective disorders, typical symptoms in those with schizophrenia mainly include so-called “poverty of speech,” reduced word and sentence production, impaired processing of complex syntax, pragmatic language deficits as well as reduced semantic verbal fluency. At the at-risk state, “poverty of content,” pragmatic difficulties and reduced verbal fluency could be of predictive value.

Discussion
The current results support multilevel alterations of the language system in persons with schizophrenia. Creative expressions of psychotic experiences are frequently found but are not in the focus of this review. Clinical examinations of linguistic alterations can support differential diagnostics and early detection. Computational methods (Natural Language Processing) may improve the precision of corresponding diagnostics. The relations between language-related and other symptoms can improve diagnostics.},

The concept of the self has been difficult to define—one of the reasons it is now infrequently an object of enquiry for psychiatry—but findings from functional brain imaging and other neuroscience studies have provided new insights. They have elucidated how the self is supported by complex, hierarchical brain processes. Bodily sensations rise through the spinal cord, brainstem, and subcortical regions through to cortical networks, with the default mode network sitting at the apex, integrating interoceptive signals with information about the extended social environment. We discuss how this forms a “self axis”, and demonstrate how this axis is set awry by depression. Our self-axis model of depression establishes a new perspective on the disorder. It emphasises the multi-level nature of depression, and how impacts made at different explanatory levels influence others along the axis. It suggests that diverse treatments might be effective for depression, from lifestyle interventions to psychotherapies to medications: they target different aspects of the self, but changes at one level of the self axis can affect others along it. Our framework for depression establishes a central role for the self, which might again become a useful focus of investigation.},

	abstract = {Despite a longstanding and widespread influence of the diagnostic approach to mental ill health, there is an emerging and growing consensus that such psychiatric nosologies may no longer be fit for purpose in research and clinical practice. In their place, there is gathering support for a “transdiagnostic” approach that cuts across traditional diagnostic boundaries or, more radically, sets them aside altogether, to provide novel insights into how we might understand mental health difficulties. Removing the distinctions between proposed psychiatric taxa at the level of classification opens up new ways of classifying mental health problems, suggests alternative conceptualizations of the processes implicated in mental health, and provides a platform for novel ways of thinking about onset, maintenance, and clinical treatment and recovery from experiences of disabling mental distress. In this Introduction to a Special Section on Transdiagnostic Approaches to Psychopathology, we provide a narrative review of the transdiagnostic literature in order to situate the Special Section articles in context. We begin with a brief history of the diagnostic approach and outline several challenges it currently faces that arguably limit its applicability in current mental health science and practice. We then review several recent transdiagnostic approaches to classification, biopsychosocial processes, and clinical interventions, highlighting promising novel developments. Finally, we present some key challenges facing transdiagnostic science and make suggestions for a way forward., Traditional diagnostic systems may no longer be fit for purpose for classifying mental ill health, facilitating understanding of its core underlying biopsychosocial processes, nor driving clinical developments. Here we propose that ‘transdiagnostic’ approaches have the potential to better represent the clinical and scientific reality of mental health problems, reflecting the complexity, dimensionality and comorbidity that is the norm in clinical practice.},

Future directions in extended {CHR} networks include studies of sources of variance, and combination with other promising biomarkers of psychosis risk, such as cognitive and sensory processing impairments likely to be related to language.

In the era of Large Language Models, we believe it is the right time to develop {AI} assistance for computational psychotherapy. We study the task of cognitive distortion detection and propose the Diagnosis of Thought ({DoT}) prompting. {DoT} performs diagnosis on the patient's speech via three stages: subjectivity assessment to separate the facts and the thoughts; contrastive reasoning to elicit the reasoning processes supporting and contradicting the thoughts; and schema analysis to summarize the cognition schemas. The generated diagnosis rationales through the three stages are essential for assisting the professionals. Experiments demonstrate that {DoT} obtains significant improvements over {ChatGPT} for cognitive distortion detection, while generating high-quality rationales approved by human experts.},

	abstract = {This theoretical article revives a classical bridging construct, canalization, to describe a new model of a general factor of psychopathology. To achieve this, we have distinguished between two types of plasticity, an early one that we call '{TEMP}' for 'Temperature or Entropy Mediated Plasticity', and another, we call 'canalization', which is close to Hebbian plasticity. These two forms of plasticity can be most easily distinguished by their relationship to 'precision' or inverse variance; {TEMP} relates to increased model variance or decreased precision, whereas the opposite is true for canalization. {TEMP} also subsumes increased learning rate, (Ising) temperature and entropy. Dictionary definitions of 'plasticity' describe it as the property of being easily shaped or molded; {TEMP} is the better match for this. Importantly, we propose that 'pathological' phenotypes develop via mechanisms of canalization or increased model precision, as a defensive response to adversity and associated distress or dysphoria. Our model states that canalization entrenches in psychopathology, narrowing the phenotypic state-space as the agent develops expertise in their pathology. We suggest that {TEMP} - combined with gently guiding psychological support - can counter canalization. We address questions of whether and when canalization is adaptive versus maladaptive, furnish our model with references to basic and human neuroscience, and offer concrete experiments and measures to test its main hypotheses and implications.

We then consider the implications of this approach for understanding depression. We speculate that depression is a disorder of allostasis, whose myriad symptoms result from a ‘locked in’ brain that is relatively insensitive to its sensory context. We conclude with a brief discussion of the ways our approach might reveal new insights for the treatment of depression.

Those conversations contain important traces about individuals’ health risks. Recently, researchers have exploited this online information to construct mental health detection models, which aim to identify users at risk on platforms like Twitter, Reddit or Facebook. Most of these models are focused on achieving good classification results, ignoring the explainability and interpretability of the decisions. Recent research has pointed out the importance of using clinical markers, such as the use of symptoms, to improve trust in the computational models by health professionals. In this paper, we introduce transformer-based architectures designed to detect and explain the appearance of depressive symptom markers in user-generated content from social media. We present two approaches: (i) train a model to classify, and another one to explain the classifier’s decision separately and (ii) unify the two tasks simultaneously within a single model. Additionally, for this latter manner, we also investigated the performance of recent conversational Large Language Models ({LLMs}) utilizing both in-context learning and finetuning. Our models provide natural language explanations, aligning with validated symptoms, thus enabling clinicians to interpret the decisions more effectively. We evaluate our approaches using recent symptom-focused datasets, using both offline metrics and expert-in-the-loop evaluations to assess the quality of our models’ explanations. Our findings demonstrate that it is possible to achieve good classification results while generating interpretable symptom-based explanations.},

Analysing social media data to uncover potential mental health issues in individuals via their posts is a popular research direction. However, most studies focus on the classification of users suffering from depression versus healthy users, or on the detection of suicidal thoughts. In this paper, we instead aim to understand and model linguistic changes that occur when users transition from a healthy to an unhealthy state. Addressing this gap could lead to better approaches for earlier depression detection when signs are not as obvious as in cases of severe depression or suicidal ideation. In order to achieve this goal, we have collected the first dataset of textual posts by the same users before and after reportedly being diagnosed with depression. We then use this data to build multiple predictive models (based on {SVM}, Random Forests, {BERT}, {RoBERTa}, {MentalBERT}, {GPT}-3, {GPT}-3.5, Bard, and Alpaca) for the task of classifying user posts. Transformer-based models achieved the best performance, while large language models used off-the-shelf proved less effective as they produced random guesses ({GPT} and Bard) or hallucinations (Alpaca).},

Suicidal ideation forums also contained more absolutist words than anxiety and depression forums (ds {\textgreater} 1.71). We show that these differences are more reflective of absolutist thinking than psychological distress.

	abstract = {In the field of sentiment analysis, several studies have highlighted that a single sentence may express multiple, sometimes contrasting, sentiments and emotions, each with its own experiencer, target and/or cause. To this end, over the past few years researchers have started to collect and annotate data manually, in order to investigate the capabilities of automatic systems not only to distinguish between emotions, but also to capture their semantic constituents. However, currently available gold datasets are heterogeneous in size, domain, format, splits, emotion categories and role labels, making comparisons across different works difficult and hampering progress in the area. In this paper, we tackle this issue and present a unified evaluation framework focused on Semantic Role Labeling for Emotions ({SRL}4E), in which we unify several datasets tagged with emotions and semantic roles by using a common labeling scheme. We use {SRL}4E as a benchmark to evaluate how modern pretrained language models perform and analyze where we currently stand in this task, hoping to provide the tools to facilitate studies in this complex area.},

We then highlight some interesting quantitative results observed on our annotated corpus. The most notable interactions are on the one hand between emotion expression modes and genres of texts, and on the other hand between emotion expression modes and emotional categories. These observation corroborate and clarify some of the results already mentioned in other {NLP} works on emotion annotation.},

	title = {An Analysis of Annotated Corpora for Emotion Classification in Text},
	url = {https://aclanthology.org/C18-1179},
	abstract = {Several datasets have been annotated and published for classification of emotions. They differ in several ways: (1) the use of different annotation schemata (e. g., discrete label sets, including joy, anger, fear, or sadness or continuous values including valence, or arousal), (2) the domain, and, (3) the file formats. This leads to several research gaps: supervised models often only use a limited set of available resources. Additionally, no previous work has compared emotion corpora in a systematic manner. We aim at contributing to this situation with a survey of the datasets, and aggregate them in a common file format with a common annotation schema. Based on this aggregation, we perform the first cross-corpus classification experiments in the spirit of future research enabled by this paper, in order to gain insight and a better understanding of differences of models inferred from the data. This work also simplifies the choice of the most appropriate resources for developing a model for a novel domain. One result from our analysis is that a subset of corpora is better classified with models trained on a different corpus. For none of the corpora, training on all data altogether is better than using a subselection of the resources. Our unified corpus is available at http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/data/unifyemotion.},

	abstract = {The term emotion analysis in text subsumes various natural language processing tasks which have in common the goal to enable computers to understand emotions. Most popular is emotion classification in which one or multiple emotions are assigned to a predefined textual unit. While such setting is appropriate for identifying the reader's or author's emotion, emotion role labeling adds the perspective of mentioned entities and extracts text spans that correspond to the emotion cause. The underlying emotion theories agree on one important point; that an emotion is caused by some internal or external event and comprises several subcomponents, including the subjective feeling and a cognitive evaluation. We therefore argue that emotions and events are related in two ways. (1) Emotions are events; and this perspective is the fundament in natural language processing for emotion role labeling. (2) Emotions are caused by events; a perspective that is made explicit with research how to incorporate psychological appraisal theories in {NLP} models to interpret events. These two research directions, role labeling and (event-focused) emotion classification, have by and large been tackled separately. In this paper, we contextualize both perspectives and discuss open research questions.},

	abstract = {A proven therapeutic technique to overcome negative thoughts is to replace them with a more hopeful "reframed thought." Although therapy can help people practice and learn this Cognitive Reframing of Negative Thoughts, clinician shortages and mental health stigma commonly limit people's access to therapy. In this paper, we conduct a human-centered study of how language models may assist people in reframing negative thoughts. Based on psychology literature, we define a framework of seven linguistic attributes that can be used to reframe a thought. We develop automated metrics to measure these attributes and validate them with expert judgements from mental health practitioners. We collect a dataset of 600 situations, thoughts and reframes from practitioners and use it to train a retrieval-enhanced in-context learning model that effectively generates reframed thoughts and controls their linguistic attributes. To investigate what constitutes a "high-quality" reframe, we conduct an {IRB}-approved randomized field study on a large mental health website with over 2,000 participants. Amongst other findings, we show that people prefer highly empathic or specific reframes, as opposed to reframes that are overly positive. Our findings provide key implications for the use of {LMs} to assist people in overcoming negative thoughts.},

	abstract = {The most prominent tasks in emotion analysis are to assign emotions to texts and to understand how emotions manifest in language. An observation for {NLP} is that emotions can be communicated implicitly by referring to events, appealing to an empathetic, intersubjective understanding of events, even without explicitly mentioning an emotion name. In psychology, the class of emotion theories known as appraisal theories aims at explaining the link between events and emotions. Appraisals can be formalized as variables that measure a cognitive evaluation by people living through an event that they consider relevant. They include the assessment if an event is novel, if the person considers themselves to be responsible, if it is in line with the own goals, and many others. Such appraisals explain which emotions are developed based on an event, e.g., that a novel situation can induce surprise or one with uncertain consequences could evoke fear. We analyze the suitability of appraisal theories for emotion analysis in text with the goal of understanding if appraisal concepts can reliably be reconstructed by annotators, if they can be predicted by text classifiers, and if appraisal concepts help to identify emotion categories. To achieve that, we compile a corpus by asking people to textually describe events that triggered particular emotions and to disclose their appraisals. Then, we ask readers to reconstruct emotions and appraisals from the text. This setup allows us to measure if emotions and appraisals can be recovered purely from text and provides a human baseline. Our comparison of text classification methods to human annotators shows that both can reliably detect emotions and appraisals with similar performance. Therefore, appraisals constitute an alternative computational emotion analysis paradigm and further improve the categorization of emotions in text with joint models.},

This paper aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of emotional events by introducing a new French corpus of emotional narratives collected using a questionnaire for emotion regulation.

Each narrative is related to a discrete emotion and is structured based on all emotion components by the writers. We study the interaction of components and their impact on emotion classification with machine learning methods and pre-trained language models. Our results show that each component improves prediction performance, and that the best results are achieved by jointly considering all components. Our results also show the effectiveness of pre-trained language models in predicting discrete emotion from certain components, which reveal differences in how emotion components are expressed.},

The 30-item Thought and Language Disorder ({TALD}) scale is based on a detailed review of the literature, encompassing all formal thought disorder symptoms reported from the early 20th century onwards. Objectively observable symptoms as well as subjective phenomena were included. Two hundred and ten participants (146 patients {ICD}-10 diagnoses: depression n=63, schizophrenia n=63, mania n=20; 64 healthy control subjects) were interviewed and symptoms rated with the {TALD}, {TLC}, {HAMD}, {YMRS} and {SAPS}/{SANS}. A principal component analyses was performed for the {TALD} to differentiate sub-syndromes. The principal component analysis revealed four {FTD} factors; objective and subjective as well as positive and negative factor dimensions. The correlation analyses with the {TLC} and the {SAPS}/{SANS} {FTD} sub-scores demonstrated the factor validity for the objective factors. The different diagnoses showed a distinct pattern of symptom severity in each of the factors, with mania patients exhibiting the highest value in the positive, objective dimension. The scale showed good psychometric results, which makes it a practicable, nosologically-open instrument for the detailed assessment of all {FTD} dimensions. The results strengthen the importance of subjective symptom assessment reported by the patient.},

A dataset of 862 sentences, extracted from 422 open subjective reports, was recently compiled as part of the Dreamachine programme (Collective Act, 2022), an immersive multisensory experience that combines {SLS} and spatial sound in a collective setting. Although open reports extend the range of reportable phenomenology, their analysis presents significant challenges, particularly in systematically identifying patterns. To address this challenge, we implemented a data-driven approach leveraging Large Language Models and Topic Modelling to uncover and interpret latent experiential topics directly from the Dreamachine's text-based reports. Our analysis confirmed the presence of simple {VHs} typically documented in scientific studies of {SLS}, while also revealing experiences of altered states of consciousness and complex hallucinations. Building on these findings, our computational approach expands the systematic study of subjective experience by enabling data-driven analyses of open-ended phenomenological reports, capturing experiences not readily identified through standard questionnaires. By revealing rich and multifaceted aspects of experiences, our study broadens our understanding of stroboscopically-induced phenomena while highlighting the potential of Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models in the emerging field of computational (neuro)phenomenology. More generally, this approach provides a practically applicable methodology for uncovering subtle hidden patterns of subjective experience across diverse research domains.},

Unfortunately, existing {LM} pipelines are typically implemented using hard-coded "prompt templates", i.e. lengthy strings discovered via trial and error. Toward a more systematic approach for developing and optimizing {LM} pipelines, we introduce {DSPy}, a programming model that abstracts {LM} pipelines as text transformation graphs, i.e. imperative computational graphs where {LMs} are invoked through declarative modules. {DSPy} modules are parameterized, meaning they can learn (by creating and collecting demonstrations) how to apply compositions of prompting, finetuning, augmentation, and reasoning techniques. We design a compiler that will optimize any {DSPy} pipeline to maximize a given metric. We conduct two case studies, showing that succinct {DSPy} programs can express and optimize sophisticated {LM} pipelines that reason about math word problems, tackle multi-hop retrieval, answer complex questions, and control agent loops. Within minutes of compiling, a few lines of {DSPy} allow {GPT}-3.5 and llama2-13b-chat to self-bootstrap pipelines that outperform standard few-shot prompting (generally by over 25\% and 65\%, respectively) and pipelines with expert-created demonstrations (by up to 5-46\% and 16-40\%, respectively). On top of that, {DSPy} programs compiled to open and relatively small {LMs} like 770M-parameter T5 and llama2-13b-chat are competitive with approaches that rely on expert-written prompt chains for proprietary {GPT}-3.5. {DSPy} is available at https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy},
