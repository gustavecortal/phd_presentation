	abstract = {In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets. Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3 Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and multilingual retrieval. To facilitate reproducibility and promote community-driven research and development, the Qwen3 Embedding models are publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license.},

	abstract = {Dimension reduction (DR) techniques such as t-SNE, UMAP, and TriMap have demonstrated impressive visualization performance on many real-world datasets. One tension that has always faced these methods is the trade-off between preservation of global structure and preservation of local structure: these methods can either handle one or the other, but not both. In this work, our main goal is to understand what aspects of DR methods are important for preserving both local and global structure: it is difficult to design a better method without a true understanding of the choices we make in our algorithms and their empirical impact on the low-dimensional embeddings they produce. Towards the goal of local structure preservation, we provide several useful design principles for DR loss functions based on our new understanding of the mechanisms behind successful DR methods. Towards the goal of global structure preservation, our analysis illuminates that the choice of which components to preserve is important. We leverage these insights to design a new algorithm for DR, called Pairwise Controlled Manifold Approximation Projection (PaCMAP), which preserves both local and global structure. Our work provides several unexpected insights into what design choices both to make and avoid when constructing DR algorithms.},

	abstract = {We present a new technique called "t-SNE" that visualizes
high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or
three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic
Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize,
and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the
tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is
better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals
structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for
high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related,
low-dimensional manifolds, such as images ofobjects from multiple
classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure
of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on
neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data
to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We
illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and
compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques,
including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The
visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those
produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2505.09388},
	abstract = {In this work, we present Qwen3, the latest version of the Qwen model family. Qwen3 comprises a series of large language models (LLMs) designed to advance performance, efficiency, and multilingual capabilities. The Qwen3 series includes models of both dense and Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) architectures, with parameter scales ranging from 0.6 to 235 billion. A key innovation in Qwen3 is the integration of thinking mode (for complex, multi-step reasoning) and non-thinking mode (for rapid, context-driven responses) into a unified framework. This eliminates the need to switch between different models--such as chat-optimized models (e.g., GPT-4o) and dedicated reasoning models (e.g., QwQ-32B)--and enables dynamic mode switching based on user queries or chat templates. Meanwhile, Qwen3 introduces a thinking budget mechanism, allowing users to allocate computational resources adaptively during inference, thereby balancing latency and performance based on task complexity. Moreover, by leveraging the knowledge from the flagship models, we significantly reduce the computational resources required to build smaller-scale models, while ensuring their highly competitive performance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Qwen3 achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks, including tasks in code generation, mathematical reasoning, agent tasks, etc., competitive against larger MoE models and proprietary models. Compared to its predecessor Qwen2.5, Qwen3 expands multilingual support from 29 to 119 languages and dialects, enhancing global accessibility through improved cross-lingual understanding and generation capabilities. To facilitate reproducibility and community-driven research and development, all Qwen3 models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.},

The incorporation of smartphones and wearable devices in clinical trials provide a unique opportunity to monitor behavior in a non-invasive manner. The objective of this study is to identify the correlations between remotely monitored self-reported assessments and objectively measured activities with depression severity assessments often applied in clinical trials. 30 unipolar depressed patients and 29 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Each participant’s daily physiological, physical, and social activity were monitored using a smartphone-based application (CHDR MORE™) for 3 weeks continuously. Self-reported depression anxiety stress scale-21 (DASS-21) and positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS) were administered via smartphone weekly and daily respectively. The structured interview guide for the Hamilton depression scale and inventory of depressive symptomatology–clinical rated (SIGHD-IDSC) was administered in-clinic weekly. Nested cross-validated linear mixed-effects models were used to identify the correlation between the CHDR MORE™ features with the weekly in-clinic SIGHD-IDSC scores. The SIGHD-IDSC regression model demonstrated an explained variance (R2) of 0.80, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of ± 15 points. The SIGHD-IDSC total scores were positively correlated with the DASS and mean steps-per-minute, and negatively correlated with the travel duration. Unobtrusive, remotely monitored behavior and self-reported outcomes are correlated with depression severity. While these features cannot replace the SIGHD-IDSC for estimating depression severity, it can serve as a complementary approach for assessing depression and drug effects outside the clinic.},

	abstract = {Background: While speech analysis holds promise for mental health assessment, research often focuses on single symptoms, despite symptom co-occurrences and interactions. In addition, predictive models in mental health do not properly assess the limitations of speech-based systems, such as uncertainty, or fairness for a safe clinical deployment. Objective: We investigated the predictive potential of mobile-collected speech data for detecting and estimating depression, anxiety, fatigue, and insomnia, focusing on other factors than mere accuracy, in the general population. Methods: We included 865 healthy adults and recorded their answers regarding their perceived mental and sleep states. We asked how they felt and if they had slept well lately. Clinically validated questionnaires measuring depression, anxiety, insomnia, and fatigue severity were also used. We developed a novel speech and machine learning pipeline involving voice activity detection, feature extraction, and model training. We automatically modeled speech with pretrained deep learning models that were pretrained on a large, open, and free database, and we selected the best one on the validation set. Based on the best speech modeling approach, clinical threshold detection, individual score prediction, model uncertainty estimation, and performance fairness across demographics (age, sex, and education) were evaluated. We used a train-validation-test split for all evaluations: to develop our models, select the best ones, and assess the generalizability of held-out data. Results: The best model was Whisper M with a max pooling and oversampling method. Our methods achieved good detection performance for all symptoms, depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9: area under the curve [AUC]=0.76; F1-score=0.49 and Beck Depression Inventory: AUC=0.78; F1-score=0.65), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale: AUC=0.77; F1-score=0.50), insomnia (Athens Insomnia Scale: AUC=0.73; F1-score=0.62), and fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory total score: AUC=0.68; F1-score=0.88). The system performed well when it needed to abstain from making predictions, as demonstrated by low abstention rates in depression detection with the Beck Depression Inventory and fatigue, with risk-coverage AUCs below 0.4. Individual symptom scores were accurately predicted (correlations were all significant with Pearson strengths between 0.31 and 0.49). Fairness analysis revealed that models were consistent for sex (average disparity ratio [DR] 0.86, SD 0.13), to a lesser extent for education level (average DR 0.47, SD 0.30), and worse for age groups (average DR 0.33, SD 0.30). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of speech-based systems for multifaceted mental health assessment in the general population, not only for detecting clinical thresholds but also for estimating their severity. Addressing fairness and incorporating uncertainty estimation with selective classification are key contributions that can enhance the clinical utility and responsible implementation of such systems.},

Two joint papers present the inter-rater and test-retest reliability of the MINI the validity versus the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) (this paper) and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R patients (SCID) (joint paper). Three-hundred and forty-six patients (296 psychiatric and 50 non-psychiatric) were administered the MINI and the CIDI ‘gold standard’. Forty two were interviewed by two investigators and 42 interviewed subsequently within two days. Interviewers were trained to use both instruments. The mean duration of the interview was 21 min with the MINI and 92 for corresponding sections of the CIDI. Kappa coefficient, sensitivity and specificity were good or very good for all diagnoses with the exception of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) (kappa = 0.36), agoraphobia (sensitivity = 0.59) and bulimia (kappa = 0.53). Interrater and test-retest reliability were good. The main reasons for discrepancies were identified.

Ratings of 54 English and 52 Swedish patients on a 65 item comprehensive psychopathology scale were used to identify the 17 most commonly occurring symptoms in primary depressive illness in the combined sample. Ratings on these 17 items for 64 patients participating in studies of four different antidepressant drugs were used to create a depression scale consisting of the 10 items which showed the largest changes with treatment and the highest correlation to overall change. The inner-rater reliability of the new depression scale was high. Scores on the scale correlated significantly with scores on a standard rating scale for depression, the Hamilton Rating Scale (HRS), indicating its validity as a general severity estimate. Its capacity to differentiate between responders and non-responders to antidepressant treatment was better than the HRS, indicating greater sensitivity to change. The practical and ethical implications in terms of smaller sample sizes in clinical trials are discussed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for screening to detect major depression.
DESIGN: Individual participant data meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCES: Medline, Medline In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, PsycINFO, and Web of Science (January 2000-February 2015).
INCLUSION CRITERIA: Eligible studies compared PHQ-9 scores with major depression diagnoses from validated diagnostic interviews. Primary study data and study level data extracted from primary reports were synthesized. For PHQ-9 cut-off scores 5-15, bivariate random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity, separately, among studies that used semistructured diagnostic interviews, which are designed for administration by clinicians; fully structured interviews, which are designed for lay administration; and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric (MINI) diagnostic interviews, a brief fully structured interview. Sensitivity and specificity were examined among participant subgroups and, separately, using meta-regression, considering all subgroup variables in a single model.
RESULTS: Data were obtained for 58 of 72 eligible studies (total n=17 357; major depression cases n=2312). Combined sensitivity and specificity was maximized at a cut-off score of 10 or above among studies using a semistructured interview (29 studies, 6725 participants; sensitivity 0.88, 95\% confidence interval 0.83 to 0.92; specificity 0.85, 0.82 to 0.88). Across cut-off scores 5-15, sensitivity with semistructured interviews was 5-22\% higher than for fully structured interviews (MINI excluded; 14 studies, 7680 participants) and 2-15\% higher than for the MINI (15 studies, 2952 participants). Specificity was similar across diagnostic interviews. The PHQ-9 seems to be similarly sensitive but may be less specific for younger patients than for older patients; a cut-off score of 10 or above can be used regardless of age..
CONCLUSIONS: PHQ-9 sensitivity compared with semistructured diagnostic interviews was greater than in previous conventional meta-analyses that combined reference standards. A cut-off score of 10 or above maximized combined sensitivity and specificity overall and for subgroups.

METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify studies that validated the GAD-7 or GAD-2 against a recognized gold standard diagnosis. Pooled estimates of diagnostic test accuracy were produced using random-effects bivariate metaanalysis. Heterogeneity was explored using the I(2) statistic.
RESULTS: A total of 12 samples were identified involving 5223 participants; 11 samples provided data on the accuracy of the GAD-7 for identifying generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Pooled sensitivity and specificity values appeared acceptable at a cutoff point of 8 [sensitivity: 0.83 (95\% CI 0.71-0.91), specificity: 0.84 (95\% CI 0.70-0.92)] although cutoff scores 7-10 also had similar pooled estimates of sensitivity/specificity. Six samples provided data on the accuracy of the GAD-2 for identifying GAD. Pooled sensitivity and specificity values appeared acceptable at a cutoff of 3 [sensitivity: 0.76 (95\% CI 0.55-0.89), specificity: 0.81 (95\% CI 0.60-0.92)]. Four studies looked at the accuracy of the questionnaires for identifying any anxiety disorder.
CONCLUSIONS: The GAD-7 had acceptable properties for identifying GAD at cutoff scores 7-10. The GAD-2 had acceptable properties for identifying GAD at a cutoff score of 3. Further validation studies are needed.},

A significant positive correlation (r) was found between the AIS and the ISI (r = 0.80, p {\textless} 0.001). As a result of describing receiver-operator curves, the severity criteria of the AIS are capable of categorizing insomnia severity as follows: absence of insomnia (0-5), mild insomnia (6-9), moderate insomnia (10-15), and severe insomnia (16-24). In addition, compared to all scales across groups categorized by AIS or ISI, it was revealed that similar results could be obtained (all p {\textless} 0.05). Therefore, the identification of the severity of AIS in this study is important in linking the findings of epidemiological studies with those of clinical studies.},

	abstract = {BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) has set a new state-of-the-art performance on sentence-pair regression tasks like semantic textual similarity (STS). However, it requires that both sentences are fed into the network, which causes a massive computational overhead: Finding the most similar pair in a collection of 10,000 sentences requires about 50 million inference computations ({\textbackslash}textasciitilde65 hours) with BERT. The construction of BERT makes it unsuitable for semantic similarity search as well as for unsupervised tasks like clustering. In this publication, we present Sentence-BERT (SBERT), a modification of the pretrained BERT network that use siamese and triplet network structures to derive semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine-similarity. This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair from 65 hours with BERT / RoBERTa to about 5 seconds with SBERT, while maintaining the accuracy from BERT. We evaluate SBERT and SRoBERTa on common STS tasks and transfer learning tasks, where it outperforms other state-of-the-art sentence embeddings methods.},

	abstract = {Introduction Impulsivity is present in a range of mental disorders and has been associated with suicide. Traditional measures of impulsivity have certain limitations, such as the lack of ecological validity. Virtual reality (VR) may overcome these issues. This study aims to validate the VR assessment tool ‘Spheres \& Shield Maze Task’ and speech analysis by comparing them with traditional measures. We hypothesise that these innovative tools will be reliable and acceptable by patients, potentially improving the simultaneous assessment of impulsivity and decision-making.
Methods and analysis This study will be carried out at the University Hospital Fundación Jiménez Díaz (Madrid, Spain). Our sample will consist of adults divided into three groups: psychiatric outpatients with a history of suicidal thoughts and/or behaviours, psychiatric outpatients without such a history and healthy volunteers. The target sample size was established at 300 participants (100 per group). Participants will complete the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale 11; the Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance, Sensation Seeking, Positive Urgency, Impulsive Behaviour Scale; Iowa Gambling Task; Continuous Performance Test; Stop signal Task, and Go/no-go task, three questions of emotional affect, the Spheres \& Shield Maze Task and two satisfaction surveys. During these tasks, participant speech will be recorded. Construct validity of the VR environment will be calculated. We will also explore the association between VR-assessed impulsivity and history of suicidal thoughts and/or behaviour, and the association between speech and impulsivity and decision-making.
Ethics and dissemination This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Fundación Jiménez Díaz (PIC128-21\_FJD). Participants will be required to provide written informed consent. The findings will be presented in a series of manuscripts that will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals for publication.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Research on suicide prevention and interventions requires a standard method for assessing both suicidal ideation and behavior to identify those at risk and to track treatment response. The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was designed to quantify the severity of suicidal ideation and behavior. The authors examined the psychometric properties of the scale.
METHOD: The C-SSRS's validity relative to other measures of suicidal ideation and behavior and the internal consistency of its intensity of ideation subscale were analyzed in three multisite studies: a treatment study of adolescent suicide attempters (N=124); a medication efficacy trial with depressed adolescents (N=312); and a study of adults presenting to an emergency department for psychiatric reasons (N=237).
RESULTS: The C-SSRS demonstrated good convergent and divergent validity with other multi-informant suicidal ideation and behavior scales and had high sensitivity and specificity for suicidal behavior classifications compared with another behavior scale and an independent suicide evaluation board. Both the ideation and behavior subscales were sensitive to change over time. The intensity of ideation subscale demonstrated moderate to strong internal consistency. In the adolescent suicide attempters study, worst-point lifetime suicidal ideation on the C-SSRS predicted suicide attempts during the study, whereas the Scale for Suicide Ideation did not. Participants with the two highest levels of ideation severity (intent or intent with plan) at baseline had higher odds for attempting suicide during the study.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the C-SSRS is suitable for assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior in clinical and research settings.},

We collected 3,151 weekly free-speech diaries from 284 German-speaking adults (156 controls, 128 with major depressive disorder) using the ReMAP smart-phone app. Automatic speech recognition produced transcripts; lexical, prosodic and openSMILE acoustics, plus sentence embeddings from the 8-billion-parameter Qwen3-8B model, were extracted. Support-vector regression with nested crossvalidation predicted Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores. Qwen3-8B embeddings substantially outperformed all classical features, achieving a mean absolute error of 4.56 points and R2 = 0.34. The best-performing model combined embeddings with lexical and prosodic metrics (MAE = 4.44, R2 = 0.35), representing only a modest improvement over embeddings alone. BERTopic applied to the embeddings revealed ten themes; depressive severity varied strongly between themes (Kruskal–Wallis H = 663.9, p {\textless} 0.001) with “Persistent Low Mood” and “Pain Distress” most associated with high BDI scores (Cliff’s δ ≤ 0.99).

Objective: This study aims to investigate a potential racial and ethnic bias among 4 popular LLMs: GPT-3.5-turbo (OpenAI), GPT-4 (OpenAI), Gemini-1.0-pro (Google), and Llama3-70b (Meta) in generating health care consumer–directed text in the absence of overtly biased queries.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the 4 LLMs were prompted to generate discharge instructions for patients with HIV. Each patient’s encounter deidentified metadata including race/ethnicity as a variable was passed over in a table format through a prompt 4 times, altering only the race/ethnicity information (African American, Asian, Hispanic White, and non-Hispanic White) each time, while keeping all other information constant. The prompt requested the model to write discharge instructions for each encounter without explicitly mentioning race or ethnicity. The LLM-generated instructions were analyzed for sentiment, subjectivity, reading ease, and word frequency by race/ethnicity.
Results: The only observed statistically significant difference between race/ethnicity groups was found in entity count (GPT-4, df=42, P=.047). However, post hoc chi-square analysis for GPT-4’s entity counts showed no significant pairwise differences among race/ethnicity categories after Bonferroni correction.
Conclusions: A total of 4 LLMs were relatively invariant to race/ethnicity in terms of linguistic and readability measures. While our study used proxy linguistic and readability measures to investigate racial and ethnic bias among 4 LLM responses in a health care–related task, there is an urgent need to establish universally accepted standards for measuring bias in LLM-generated responses. Further studies are needed to validate these results and assess their implications.},

	abstract = {Male suicide rates represent a public health crisis. In almost every country, more men die by suicide than women and suicide is a leading cause of death for men in the United States and the United Kingdom. Evidence suggests that men are less likely than women to access professional support for suicidal distress. Ensuring more men access support is a critical component of suicide prevention. This study explores responses from 725 men, worldwide, who have attempted suicide or have had thoughts of suicide in the last year, to an open-text question about the barriers they experience to accessing professional support. Using a thematic analysis, results reveal the multifaceted barriers some men experience regarding a lack of motivation, a lack of psychological capability, and/or a lack of physical/social opportunity to access support. Findings suggest that many men have sought support but had negative experiences and that many others want help but cannot access it. Barriers include prohibitive costs and waiting times; potential costs to identity, autonomy, relationships and future life opportunities; a lack of perceived psychological capability; a lack of belief in the utility of services and a mistrust of mental health professionals. Findings suggest the importance of examining the role of male gender in male help-seeking behaviours. We suggest 23 recommendations for services and public health messaging to increase men's help-seeking behaviours.},

	abstract = {We aim to use topic modeling, an approach for discovering clusters of related words (“topics”), to predict symptom severity and therapeutic alliance in psychotherapy transcripts, while also identifying the most important topics and overarching themes for prediction. We analyzed 552 psychotherapy transcripts from 124 patients. Using BERTopic (Grootendorst, 2022), we extracted 250 topics each for patient and therapist speech. These topics were used to predict symptom severity and alliance with various competing machine-learning methods. Sensitivity analyses were calculated for a model based on 50 topics, LDA-based topic modeling, and a bigram model. Additionally, we grouped topics into themes using qualitative analysis and identified key topics and themes with eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Symptom severity could be predicted with highest accuracy by patient topics (\$\$r\$\$=0.45, 95\%-CI 0.40, 0.51), whereas alliance was better predicted by therapist topics (\$\$r\$\$=0.20, 95\%-CI 0.16, 0.24). Drivers for symptom severity were themes related to health and negative experiences. Lower alliance was correlated with various themes, especially psychotherapy framework, income, and everyday life. This analysis shows the potential of using topic modeling in psychotherapy research allowing to predict several treatment-relevant metrics with reasonable accuracy. Further, the use of XAI allows for an analysis of the individual predictive value of topics and themes. Limitations entail heterogeneity across different topic modeling hyperparameters and a relatively small sample size.},

	abstract = {Depression has robust natural language correlates and can increasingly be measured in language using predictive models. However, despite evidence that language use varies as a function of individual demographic features (e.g., age, gender), previous work has not systematically examined whether and how depression’s association with language varies by race. We examine how race moderates the relationship between language features (i.e., first-person pronouns and negative emotions) from social media posts and self-reported depression, in a matched sample of Black and White English speakers in the United States. Our findings reveal moderating effects of race: While depression severity predicts I-usage in White individuals, it does not in Black individuals. White individuals use more belongingness and self-deprecation-related negative emotions. Machine learning models trained on similar amounts of data to predict depression severity performed poorly when tested on Black individuals, even when they were trained exclusively using the language of Black individuals. In contrast, analogous models tested on White individuals performed relatively well. Our study reveals surprising race-based differences in the expression of depression in natural language and highlights the need to understand these effects better, especially before language-based models for detecting psychological phenomena are integrated into clinical practice.},

It is also acknowledged that LLMs introduce challenges related to computational demands, potential for misinterpretation, and ethical concerns, necessitating the development of pragmatic frameworks to ensure their safe deployment. We explore both the promise of LLMs in enriching psychiatric care and research through examples such as predictive analytics and therapy chatbots and risks including labor substitution, privacy concerns, and the necessity for responsible AI practices. We conclude by advocating for processes to develop responsible guardrails, including red-teaming, multi-stakeholder-oriented safety, and ethical guidelines/frameworks, to mitigate risks and harness the full potential of LLMs for advancing mental health.},

By employing LDA topic modeling and sentiment analysis, we found that the Bipolar disorder online community on Reddit discussed various aspects of the condition, including symptoms, mood swings, diagnosis, and medication. Users shared personal experiences, challenges, and coping strategies, seeking support and connection. Discussions related to therapy and medication were prevalent, emphasizing the importance of finding suitable therapists and managing medication side effects. The online community serves as a platform for seeking help, advice, and information, highlighting the role of social support in managing bipolar disorder. This study enhances our understanding of individuals living with bipolar disorder and provides valuable insights and feedback for researchers developing mental health interventions.},

	abstract = {Background
The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting mental health, but it is not clear how people with different types of mental health problems were differentially impacted as the initial wave of cases hit.

Objective
The aim of this study is to leverage natural language processing (NLP) with the goal of characterizing changes in 15 of the world’s largest mental health support groups (eg, r/schizophrenia, r/SuicideWatch, r/Depression) found on the website Reddit, along with 11 non–mental health groups (eg, r/PersonalFinance, r/conspiracy) during the initial stage of the pandemic.

Methods
We created and released the Reddit Mental Health Dataset including posts from 826,961 unique users from 2018 to 2020. Using regression, we analyzed trends from 90 text-derived features such as sentiment analysis, personal pronouns, and semantic categories. Using supervised machine learning, we classified posts into their respective support groups and interpreted important features to understand how different problems manifest in language. We applied unsupervised methods such as topic modeling and unsupervised clustering to uncover concerns throughout Reddit before and during the pandemic.

Results
We found that the r/HealthAnxiety forum showed spikes in posts about COVID-19 early on in January, approximately 2 months before other support groups started posting about the pandemic. There were many features that significantly increased during COVID-19 for specific groups including the categories “economic stress,” “isolation,” and “home,” while others such as “motion” significantly decreased. We found that support groups related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, eating disorders, and anxiety showed the most negative semantic change during the pandemic out of all mental health groups. Health anxiety emerged as a general theme across Reddit through independent supervised and unsupervised machine learning analyses. For instance, we provide evidence that the concerns of a diverse set of individuals are converging in this unique moment of history; we discovered that the more users posted about COVID-19, the more linguistically similar (less distant) the mental health support groups became to r/HealthAnxiety (ρ=–0.96, P{\textless}.001). Using unsupervised clustering, we found the suicidality and loneliness clusters more than doubled in the number of posts during the pandemic. Specifically, the support groups for borderline personality disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder became significantly associated with the suicidality cluster. Furthermore, clusters surrounding self-harm and entertainment emerged.

Conclusions
By using a broad set of NLP techniques and analyzing a baseline of prepandemic posts, we uncovered patterns of how specific mental health problems manifest in language, identified at-risk users, and revealed the distribution of concerns across Reddit, which could help provide better resources to its millions of users. We then demonstrated that textual analysis is sensitive to uncover mental health complaints as they appear in real time, identifying vulnerable groups and alarming themes during COVID-19, and thus may have utility during the ongoing pandemic and other world-changing events such as elections and protests.},

We are interested in how the language and the content on these platforms differ from each other. We scrape both forums for a specific period. Next to general methods of computational text analysis, we focus on sentiment analysis, topic modeling and the distribution of word categories to analyze these forums. Our results indicate that Beyond Blue is generally more positive and that the users are more supportive to each other. Topic modeling shows that Beyond Blue's users talk more about adult topics like finance and work while topics shaped by school or college terms are more prevalent on r/depression.

	abstract = {Background
Prior research has associated spoken language use with depression, yet studies often involve small or non-clinical samples and face challenges in the manual transcription of speech. This paper aimed to automatically identify depression-related topics in speech recordings collected from clinical samples.
Methods
The data included 3919 English free-response speech recordings collected via smartphones from 265 participants with a depression history. We transcribed speech recordings via automatic speech recognition (Whisper tool, OpenAI) and identified principal topics from transcriptions using a deep learning topic model (BERTopic). To identify depression risk topics and understand the context, we compared participants' depression severity and behavioral (extracted from wearable devices) and linguistic (extracted from transcribed texts) characteristics across identified topics.
Results
From the 29 topics identified, we identified 6 risk topics for depression: ‘No Expectations’, ‘Sleep’, ‘Mental Therapy’, ‘Haircut’, ‘Studying’, and ‘Coursework’. Participants mentioning depression risk topics exhibited higher sleep variability, later sleep onset, and fewer daily steps and used fewer words, more negative language, and fewer leisure-related words in their speech recordings.
Limitations
Our findings were derived from a depressed cohort with a specific speech task, potentially limiting the generalizability to non-clinical populations or other speech tasks. Additionally, some topics had small sample sizes, necessitating further validation in larger datasets.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates that specific speech topics can indicate depression severity. The employed data-driven workflow provides a practical approach for analyzing large-scale speech data collected from real-world settings.},

In persons with schizophrenia, language-related alterations can occur at all linguistic levels. Differentiating from findings in persons with affective disorders, typical symptoms in those with schizophrenia mainly include so-called "poverty of speech", reduced word and sentence production, impaired processing of complex syntax, pragmatic language deficits as well as reduced semantic verbal fluency. At the at-risk state, "poverty of content", pragmatic difficulties and reduced verbal fluency could be of predictive value.The current results support multilevel alterations of the language system in persons with schizophrenia. Creative expressions of psychotic experiences are frequently found but are not in the focus of this review. Clinical examinations of linguistic alterations can support differential diagnostics and early detection. Computational methods (Natural Language Processing) may improve the precision of corresponding diagnostics. The relations between language-related and other symptoms can improve diagnostics.},

However, studies in this direction are only at the beginning and are difficult to implement due to linguistic variability and the influence of cultural contexts. Aim: This study aims to identify language markers specific to MDD through an automated analysis process based on RO-2015 LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count).Materials and Methods: A sample of 62 medicated patients with MDD and a sample of 43 controls were assessed. Each participant provided language samples that described something that was pleasant for them.Assessment tools: (1) Screening tests for MDD (MADRS and DASS-21); (2) Ro-LIWC2015 – Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count – a computerized text analysis software, validated for Romanian Language, that analyzes morphology, syntax and semantics of word use.Results: Depressive patients use different approaches in sentence structure, and communicate in short sentences. This requires multiple use of the punctuation mark period, which implicitly requires directive communication, limited in exchange of ideas. Also, participants from the sample with depression mostly use impersonal pronouns, first person pronoun in plural form – not singular, a limited number of prepositions and an increased number of conjunctions, auxiliary verbs, negations, verbs in the past tense, and much less in the present tense, increased use of words expressing negative affects, anxiety, with limited use of words indicating positive affects. The favorite topics of interest of patients with depression are leisure, time and money.Conclusion: Depressive patients use a significantly different language pattern than people without mood or behavioral disorders, both in form and content. These differences are sometimes associated with years of education and sex, and might also be explained by cultural differences.},

All speech samples were transcribed by a professional linguist who was blind to both identity and diagnosis of the patients. The majority of the deviant linguistic variables was found to be common to all three diagnostic groups under comparison, while only a few linguistic variables exhibited statistically significant between-group differences. On the other hand, when the respective variables were analysed as a multivariate entity, the variety of subtle between-group differences allowed us to discriminate between the diagnostic groups at an overall performance of 72.7\% correctly classified patients. There was an almost complete lack of association between linguistic abnormalities and psychopathology syndromes. In particular, we found no correlation between the syndrome ‘formal thought disorder’ and the large variety of linguistic variables used in this investigation. In consequence, we conjecture that linguistically deviant speech characteristics represent an independent syndrome complex manifested at varying intensities across mental illnesses, and that this syndrome complex deserves greater attention, not only with respect to the principal understanding of the underlying disturbances, but also as a potential target of therapeutical intervention.},

Conventional topic models (e.g., LDA) represent topics as bags of words that often require “reading the tea leaves” to interpret; additionally, they offer users minimal control over the formatting and specificity of resulting topics. To tackle these issues, we introduce TopicGPT, a prompt-based framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to uncover latent topics in a text collection. TopicGPT produces topics that align better with human categorizations compared to competing methods: it achieves a harmonic mean purity of 0.74 against human-annotated Wikipedia topics compared to 0.64 for the strongest baseline. Its topics are also more interpretable, dispensing with ambiguous bags of words in favor of topics with natural language labels and associated free-form descriptions. Moreover, the framework is highly adaptable, allowing users to specify constraints and modify topics without the need for model retraining. By streamlining access to high-quality and interpretable topics, TopicGPT represents a compelling, human-centered approach to topic modeling.},

In this work, we investigate the untapped potential of large language models (LLMs) as an alternative for uncovering the underlying topics within extensive text corpora. To this end, we introduce a framework that prompts LLMs to generate topics from a given set of documents and establish evaluation protocols to assess the clustering efficacy of LLMs. Our findings indicate that LLMs with appropriate prompts can stand out as a viable alternative, capable of generating relevant topic titles and adhering to human guidelines to refine and merge topics.

Twenty-two case studies (published after 2001) were included in the meta-analysis, which comprised 76 comparisons between control and treatment groups. Most studies came from the United States, followed by Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Studies reported a wide range of health outcomes, such as reductions in depression, anxiety, and body mass index, as well as increases in life satisfaction, quality of life, and sense of community. Meta-analytic estimates showed a significant positive effect of gardening on the health outcomes both for all and sets of subgroup studies, whilst effect sizes differed among eight subgroups. Although Egger's test indicated the presence of publication bias, significant positive effects of gardening remained after adjusting for this using trim and fill analysis.

	abstract = {Background
Loneliness has long been associated with depressive symptoms, but there is no evidence on the question of “which comes first”. To help us to answer this question, this study conducted a meta-analysis using a cross-lagged formula to examine the reciprocal relations between loneliness and depressive symptoms, as well as potential moderators.
Methods
The meta-analytic dataset consisted of 37 studies with sample sizes ranging from 52 to 5991. Effect sizes (including autoregressive effects and lagged coefficients) were included. We computed weighted mean effect sizes for the correlation effect and cross-lagged effect between loneliness and depressive symptoms. We also performed a meta-regression to investigate potential moderators.
Results
The results showed that loneliness and depressive symptoms reciprocally predicted each other over time with similar effect sizes. There was no moderation of our overall effect size in either direction by time interval between measurements, the proportion of female participants, mean age of the sample, or type of measurement.
Limitations
Caution should be taken in drawing final conclusions about the relative strength of reciprocal effects between loneliness and depressive symptoms due to the potential influence of varied research focus in the included studies, which could affect the effect size.
Conclusions
These findings advance the study of the relationship between loneliness and depressive symptoms by providing evidence that the link between them is symmetrically reciprocal and robust, which may help clinicians to develop effective intervention methods.},

However, the recovery-potential of relatively long vacations and the underlying processes have been disregarded. Therefore, our study focused on vacations longer than 14 days and on the psychological processes associated with such a long respite from work. In the present study, we investigated (1) how health and well-being (H\&W) develop during and after a long summer vacation, (2) whether changes in H\&W during and after vacation relate to vacation activities and experiences and (3) whether changes in H\&W during and after vacation relate to sleep. Fifty-four employees reported their H\&W before, three or four times during and five times after vacation. Vacations lasted 23 days on average. Information on vacation experiences, work-related activities and sleep was collected during vacation. Vacation activities were assessed immediately after vacation. H\&W increased quickly during vacation, peaked on the eighth vacation day and had rapidly returned to baseline level within the first week of work resumption. Vacation duration and most vacation activities were only weakly associated with H\&W changes during and after vacation. Engagement in passive activities, savoring, pleasure derived from activities, relaxation, control and sleep showed strong relations with improved H\&W during and to a lesser degree after vacation. In conclusion, H\&W improved during long summer vacations, but this positive effect was short-lived. Vacation experiences, especially pleasure, relaxation, savoring and control, seem to be especially important for the strength and persistence of vacation (after-) effects.},

	abstract = {Background
Unemployment is associated with substantially greater depression and anxiety, constituting a considerable public health concern. The current review provides the most comprehensive synthesis to date, and first meta-analysis, of controlled intervention trials aimed at improving depression and anxiety outcomes during unemployment.
Methods
Searches were conducted within PsycInfo, Cochrane Central, PubMed and Embase from their inception to September 2022. Included studies conducted controlled trials of interventions focused on improving mental health within unemployed samples, and reported on validated measures of depression, anxiety, or distress (mixed depression and anxiety). Narrative syntheses and random effects meta-analyses were conducted among prevention- and treatment-level interventions for each outcome.
Results
A total of 39 articles reporting on 33 studies were included for review (sample sizes ranging from 21 to 1801). Both prevention and treatment interventions tended to be effective overall, with treatment interventions producing larger effect sizes than prevention interventions. The clearest evidence for particular intervention approaches emerged for prevention-level Cognitive Therapy/CBT, followed by prevention-level work-related interventions, although neither produced entirely consistent effects.
Limitations
Risk of bias was generally high across studies. Low numbers of studies within subgroups precluded any comparisons between long-term and short-term unemployment, limited comparisons among treatment studies, and reduced the power of meta-analyses.
Conclusions
Both prevention- and treatment-level mental health-focused interventions have merit for reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression among those experiencing unemployment. Cognitive Therapy/CBT and work-related interventions hold the most robust evidence base, which can inform both prevention and treatment strategies implemented by clinicians, employment services providers, and governments.},

	abstract = {Depression is the leading cause of mental health–related disease burden and may be reduced by physical activity, but the dose-response relationship between activity and depression is uncertain.To systematically review and meta-analyze the dose-response association between physical activity and incident depression from published prospective studies of adults.PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and the reference lists of systematic reviews retrieved by a systematic search up to December 11, 2020, with no language limits. The date of the search was November 12, 2020.We included prospective cohort studies reporting physical activity at 3 or more exposure levels and risk estimates for depression with 3000 or more adults and 3 years or longer of follow-up.Data extraction was completed independently by 2 extractors and cross-checked for errors. A 2-stage random-effects dose-response meta-analysis was used to synthesize data. Study-specific associations were estimated using generalized least-squares regression and the pooled association was estimated by combining the study-specific coefficients using restricted maximum likelihood.The outcome of interest was depression, including (1) presence of major depressive disorder indicated by self-report of physician diagnosis, registry data, or diagnostic interviews and (2) elevated depressive symptoms established using validated cutoffs for a depressive screening instrument.Fifteen studies comprising 191 130 participants and 2 110 588 person-years were included. An inverse curvilinear dose-response association between physical activity and depression was observed, with steeper association gradients at lower activity volumes; heterogeneity was large and significant (I2 = 74\%; P \&lt; .001). Relative to adults not reporting any activity, those accumulating half the recommended volume of physical activity (4.4 marginal metabolic equivalent task hours per week [mMET-h/wk]) had 18\% (95\% CI, 13\%-23\%) lower risk of depression. Adults accumulating the recommended volume of 8.8 mMET hours per week had 25\% (95\% CI, 18\%-32\%) lower risk with diminishing potential benefits and higher uncertainty observed beyond that exposure level. There were diminishing additional potential benefits and greater uncertainty at higher volumes of physical activity. Based on an estimate of exposure prevalences among included cohorts, if less active adults had achieved the current physical activity recommendations, 11.5\% (95\% CI, 7.7\%-15.4\%) of depression cases could have been prevented.This systematic review and meta-analysis of associations between physical activity and depression suggests significant mental health benefits from being physically active, even at levels below the public health recommendations. Health practitioners should therefore encourage any increase in physical activity to improve mental health.},

The promises of social data are many, including understanding "what the world thinks" about a social issue, brand, celebrity, or other entity, as well as enabling better decision-making in a variety of fields including public policy, healthcare, and economics.

There are methodological limitations and pitfalls, as well as ethical boundaries and unexpected consequences that are often overlooked.

	abstract = {Patients with depression almost inevitably exhibit abnormalities in sleep, such as shortened latency to enter rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and decrease in electroencephalogram delta power during non-REM sleep. Insufficient sleep can be stressful, and the accumulation of stress leads to the deterioration of mental health and contributes to the development of psychiatric disorders. Thus, it is likely that depression and sleep are bidirectionally related, i.e. development of depression contributes to sleep disturbances and vice versa. However, the relation between depression and sleep seems complicated. For example, acute sleep deprivation can paradoxically improve depressive symptoms. Thus, it is difficult to conclude whether sleep has beneficial or harmful effects in patients with depression. How antidepressants affect sleep in patients with depression might provide clues to understanding the effects of sleep, but caution is required considering that antidepressants have diverse effects other than sleep. Recent animal studies support the bidirectional relation between depression and sleep, and animal models of depression are expected to be beneficial for the identification of neuronal circuits that connect stress, sleep, and depression. This review provides a comprehensive overview regarding the current knowledge of the relationship between depression and sleep.},

	abstract = {Background
              The study of depression and anxiety using publicly available social media data is a research activity that has grown considerably over the past decade. The discussion platform Reddit has become a popular social media data source in this nascent area of study, in part because of the unique ways in which the platform is facilitative of research. To date, no work has been done to synthesize existing studies on depression and anxiety using Reddit.
            
            
              Objective
              The objective of this review is to understand the scope and nature of research using Reddit as a primary data source for studying depression and anxiety.
            
            
              Methods
              A scoping review was conducted using the Arksey and O’Malley framework. MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Scopus, ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, and ACM academic databases were searched. Inclusion criteria were developed using the participants, concept, and context framework outlined by the Joanna Briggs Institute Scoping Review Methodology Group. Eligible studies featured an analytic focus on depression or anxiety and used naturalistic written expressions from Reddit users as a primary data source.
            
            
              Results
              A total of 54 studies were included in the review. Tables and corresponding analyses delineate the key methodological features, including a comparatively larger focus on depression versus anxiety, an even split of original and premade data sets, a widespread analytic focus on classifying the mental health states of Reddit users, and practical implications that often recommend new methods of professionally delivered monitoring and outreach for Reddit users.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Studies of depression and anxiety using Reddit data are currently driven by a prevailing methodology that favors a technical, solution-based orientation. Researchers interested in advancing this research area will benefit from further consideration of conceptual issues surrounding the interpretation of Reddit data with the medical model of mental health. Further efforts are also needed to locate accountability and autonomy within practice implications, suggesting new forms of engagement with Reddit users.},

More specifically, the etm models each word with a categorical distribution whose natural parameter is the inner product between the word's embedding and an embedding of its assigned topic. To fit the etm, we develop an efficient amortized variational inference algorithm. The etm discovers interpretable topics even with large vocabularies that include rare words and stop words.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the lives of people globally for over 2 years. Changes in lifestyles due to the pandemic may cause psychosocial stressors for individuals and could lead to mental health problems. To provide high-quality mental health support, health care organizations need to identify COVID-19-specific stressors and monitor the trends in the prevalence of those stressors.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to social media data to identify the psychosocial stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic and to analyze the trend in the prevalence of these stressors at different stages of the pandemic.
METHODS: We obtained a data set of 9266 Reddit posts from the subreddit {\textbackslash}rCOVID19\_support, from February 14, 2020, to July 19, 2021. We used the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model to identify the topics that were mentioned on the subreddit and analyzed the trends in the prevalence of the topics. Lexicons were created for each of the topics and were used to identify the topics of each post. The prevalences of topics identified by the LDA and lexicon approaches were compared.
RESULTS: The LDA model identified 6 topics from the data set: (1) "fear of coronavirus," (2) "problems related to social relationships," (3) "mental health symptoms," (4) "family problems," (5) "educational and occupational problems," and (6) "uncertainty on the development of pandemic." According to the results, there was a significant decline in the number of posts about the "fear of coronavirus" after vaccine distribution started. This suggests that the distribution of vaccines may have reduced the perceived risks of coronavirus. The prevalence of discussions on the uncertainty about the pandemic did not decline with the increase in the vaccinated population. In April 2021, when the Delta variant became prevalent in the United States, there was a significant increase in the number of posts about the uncertainty of pandemic development but no obvious effects on the topic of fear of the coronavirus.
CONCLUSIONS: We created a dashboard to visualize the trend in the prevalence of topics about COVID-19-related stressors being discussed on a social media platform (Reddit). Our results provide insights into the prevalence of pandemic-related stressors during different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The NLP techniques leveraged in this study could also be applied to analyze event-specific stressors in the future.},

	abstract = {Topic modeling is used for discovering latent semantic structure, usually referred to as topics, in a large collection of documents. The most widely used methods are Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis. Despite their popularity they have several weaknesses. In order to achieve optimal results they often require the number of topics to be known, custom stop-word lists, stemming, and lemmatization. Additionally these methods rely on bag-of-words representation of documents which ignore the ordering and semantics of words. Distributed representations of documents and words have gained popularity due to their ability to capture semantics of words and documents. We present \${\textbackslash}texttt\{top2vec\}\$, which leverages joint document and word semantic embedding to find \${\textbackslash}textit\{topic vectors\}\$. This model does not require stop-word lists, stemming or lemmatization, and it automatically finds the number of topics. The resulting topic vectors are jointly embedded with the document and word vectors with distance between them representing semantic similarity. Our experiments demonstrate that \${\textbackslash}texttt\{top2vec\}\$ finds topics which are significantly more informative and representative of the corpus trained on than probabilistic generative models.},
